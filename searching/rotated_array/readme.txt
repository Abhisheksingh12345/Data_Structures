In this problem we are given a sorted array that i
rotated a certain number of times . 
Our task is to detect the presence of 
a given target element in the array . 
We will first have a look at the naive approach 
that requires O(n) time complexity and 
later the Efficient approach which 
employs binary search to achieve logarithmic 
time complexity
