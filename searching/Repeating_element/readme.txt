In this problem, 
we have an array where each 
element appears only once except 
for a single element that has 
multiple occurrences. 
Additionally, the array always contains 
the number 0, and if the maximum element 
in the array is x, then all elements 
from 0 to x are guaranteed to be present 
in the array. We will have a look at both the naive and the efficient approach to solve this problem.
